# Benchmark Generation Framework with Customizable Distortions for Image Classifier Robustness

This repository contains the datasets and code for the paper .

## Introduction
Trust-ml is a machine learning-driven adversarial data generator that introduces naturally occurring distortions to the original dataset to generate an adversarial subset. This framework provides a custom mix of distrotions for evaluating robustness of image classification models against both true negatives and false positives.

## Documentation and Installation
Refer to the [docs](https://hewlettpackard.github.io/trust-ml/) for documentation of the Trust-ml.
